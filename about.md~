I am in my final year as a mechanical engineering student at the University of Guelph.  I specialize in mechatronic systems, with a passion for manufacturing and design.  I love solving problems and I'm always looking for ways to improve systems and maximize potential!

Currently I am working on developing my first application for Windows 10.  While I know it won't set the world on fire, I'm excited to take my first step into software development.  More info to come.
